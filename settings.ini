# Settings Configuration File
# This file configures the settings for the Bing dork search tool.

[settings]

# Number of concurrent threads to use for searching.
# Adjust this value based on your system's capabilities and network conditions.
# Reducing the number of threads can help if you encounter HTTP errors due to network issues.
threads = 100

# Timeout for HTTP requests, in seconds.
# For best results, keep this value at 60 seconds. You can reduce it if your network is faster.
timeout = 60  # Recommended: 60 seconds for optimal performance

# Maximum number of idle connections to keep open.
# This helps manage resource usage by reusing connections instead of opening new ones for each request.
MaxIdleConns = 200

# Maximum number of idle connections to keep open per host.
# This setting fine-tunes the connection management to avoid overloading any single host.
MaxIdleConnsPerHost = 20

# Note:
# If you encounter [HTTP ERROR] 203 NON-AUTHORISED INFORMATION, it is likely due to bad internet connection.
# In such cases, try reducing the number of threads and reconnecting to your internet.

# Best Settings Ratio:
# The following ratio provides a balanced configuration for most use cases:
# threads : MaxIdleConns : MaxIdleConnsPerHost
#     1   :      2       :        0.25

# Example:
# For 100 threads, set MaxIdleConns to 200 and MaxIdleConnsPerHost to 25.
# threads = 100
# MaxIdleConns = 200
# MaxIdleConnsPerHost = 25
